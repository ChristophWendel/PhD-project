# PhD-project
Python code developed and used during my PhD time

The code consists out of 7 python files.
Subject of the code is:
1. Initialisation of the code, basic physical definitions, basic auxiliary functions, treatment of ADAF spectra
2. A toy model of AGN jets (not discussed in the dissertation)
3. A toy model of Mrk 501 (not discussed in the dissertation)
4. Numerical solution of steady-state IC pair cascades: Specification of input parameters, definition of interaction rates and initialisation of the iterative scheme
5. Numerical solution of steady-state IC pair cascades: Definitions of the terms of the electron kinetic equation, iterative scheme, plot of N, export of input parameters
6. Numerical solution of steady-state IC pair cascades: Experimental extension to synchrotron IC pair cascades: Specification of the synchrotron photons kinetic equation, super iteration
7. Numerical solution of steady-state IC pair cascades: Obsolete part to determine N in the Thomson regime, computation of the HE photon spectrum, conversion to observed flux density, comparison with observational data, main file executions
